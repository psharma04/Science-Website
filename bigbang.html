<h2>What is the Big Bang Theory?</h2>
<p> The Big Bang Theory is the most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the universe. The theory states that the Universe began in an extremely hot and dense state, then nearly 14 billion years ago began to expand at an extremely fast rate, cooling and allowing the formation of galaxies, stars and planets.</p>
<h2>What evidence is there to support the Big Bang Theory?</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
<ul>
<li>CMBR, or Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, comes from all directions of space and has a temperature of around -270Â°C. </li>
<li>The CMBR is considered the remains of the thermal energy (Heat) from the Big Bang and is spread thinly throughout the entire Universe.</li>
<li>The CMBR is not only predicted by the Big Bang Theory, but also identified as within the Microwave segment of the Electromagnetic Spectrum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mixture of elements in the Universe
<ul>
<li>As the Universe expanded and cooled down, some of the elements that we see today were created.</li>
<li> The Big Bang theory predicts how much of each element should have been made in the early universe, and what we see in very distant galaxies and old stars is just right.</li>
