<h2>Steady State Theory</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The Steady State theory is an alternative to the Big Bang theory, which states that the Universe is always expanding but maintaining a constant average density.</li>
<li>In other words, as the Universe gets bigger, more matter is created so that the mass to size ratio of the Universe is constant. </li>
<li>The Steady State theory was disproven by the CMBR. If the Steady State Theory was correct, then the CMBR would be about 3 times hotter than it currently is.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Cyclic Model (Oscillating Universe)</h2>
<p>
The Cyclic Model, or Oscillating Universe, is an extension of the Big Bang theory that states that over a long enough period of time, gravity (the force that pulls two objects together) will become strong enough to pull the entire Universe back in on itself in a “Big Crunch,” reforming the initial singularity, and then causing another Big Bang, creating an endless loop of expansion and contraction of the entire Universe.</li>
</p><p>
The Oscillating Universe Model can be disproven by the Law of Conservation of Energy, which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only changed from one form to another. A Universe where gravity can overpower the expansion constant (the speed at which the Universe expands) would eventually reach a state of equilibrium, neither expanding nor contracting, gravity and the expansion constant perfectly balancing each other out. This event has been referred to as the Big Freeze, as it would require all matter and energy to be equally spaced out, and therefore completely non-interactive: a Universe frozen forever.
